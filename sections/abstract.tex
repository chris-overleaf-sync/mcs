\begin{abstract}
Datasets containing ground truth solutions to the maximum common connected induced subgraph problem are developed and verified for three databases of graphs: AIDS, LINUX, and IMDB. The solutions are analyzed to estimate input graph size limitations for practical, state-of-the-art, optimal solvers. The datasets are used in a supervised learning setting for the task of graph similarity search. Preliminary results indicate that maximum common subgraph is a practical metric for use in graph similarity search and that it is learnable by state-of-the-art deep learning models.
