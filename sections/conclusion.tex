\section{Conclusion}
We develop three ground truth datasets containing solutions to the MCS problem using an existing implementation of an exact MCS solver. The datasets were used to identify practical solution limitations for the associated exact solvers. Training a state-of-the-art deep learning architecture using these datasets shows that it is possible to learn MCS size. These datasets enable a new research direction of developing an architecture that is capable of learning MCS mapping as well as MCS size.
